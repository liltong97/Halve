# About Me

I am a bioengineer turned data scientist, currently doing a 12-week data science bootcamp called Metis. I'm hoping that this blog will detail my growth into a full fledged guru and provide me a space to share my experiences and interests. 

Feel free to contact me with questions and/or thoughts on anything you find here!
